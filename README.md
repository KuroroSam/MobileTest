# MobileTest

Clone it! Don't fork it or other people can see your implementation.

Please refer the iOS project, there are bare bone implementation so you can verify your enviroment is workable for further development. 

This simple application has 2 screen, which are list screen and upload screen.

The basic functionality you need to implement are:
For the list screen
- display collection of uploaded photo. 

For the upload screen,
- upload a photo through drawing api. The nature :smiling_imp: of this api will randomly block you serveral second so your UI should consider to embrace or avoid concurrency.
- pick a last taken photo from device library

You will be evaluated on: 
- technical capability of the code
- code structure of how easy to write, debug and maintain
- UI presentation
- other design decisions

You are expceted to implement this user interface for iOS, android or window mobile. We recommend you to focus on your favourite platform but you gain a bouns if you can make it works for both.
